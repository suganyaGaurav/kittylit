app Folder Overview

The app/ module contains all backend components for the KittyLit application — including caching, configuration management, request routing, data utilities, service logic, and governance filters. Each file is separated for clarity, maintainability, and long-term scalability.

1. __init__.py

Initializes the app package.
Handles module-level imports and ensures clean namespace structure.

2. cache.py

Implements caching for books and metadata.
Used to reduce DB lookups and speed up UI + agent responses.

Purpose: Faster runtime execution, warm-start mechanisms.
Notes: Designed to support in-memory cache or Redis in future.

3. config.py

Central configuration file.
Controls environment variables, paths, feature flags, and operational settings.

Purpose: Keeps all constants in one place.

4. data_loader.py

Reads dataset files (JSON/DB) and prepares dropdown values for UI.
Separates data logic from the main application.

Purpose: Clean preprocessing and reusable data utilities.

5. db_utils.py

Database utility functions for SQLite.
Handles connections, queries, inserts, updates, and result formatting.

Purpose: Keeps DB operations clean and modular.

6. errors.py

Custom exceptions and structured error handlers.
Used by UI, agents, and backend for predictable error flows.

Purpose: Makes debugging easier and enforces governance.

7. options.py

Stores constants such as VALID_YEARS, ALLOWED_GENRES, etc.
Imported by routes and services.

Purpose: Single source of truth for dropdowns and validation rules.

8. routes.py

Defines Flask routes for:

Homepage

Book search

Dropdown loading

API endpoints

Purpose: Clean HTTP routing without mixing business logic.

9. services.py

Service layer containing business logic for:

Book search

Recommendation orchestration

Connecting DB + cache + RAG

Purpose: Keeps logic separate from API endpoints, enabling testing.

10. utils.py

Helper utilities used throughout the project.
Examples: formatting, logging helpers, validation utilities.

Purpose: Avoid duplicated logic in routes/services.

11. gateways/ (folder)

Integrations with external systems (future-friendly).
Example: external APIs for book metadata.

Purpose: Keeps integration logic outside core business flow.
